<h1>Public transport lines in Brno, Czech republic</h1>
<p>Welcome to my small static website project, which displays map window based od OpenStreetMaps and Ortofoto by ČÚZK with layers of bus, trolleybus and tram lines dependent on user selection from sidebar.</p>
<h3>Resources</h3>
<p>Lines, stops and other layers are taken from <a target="_blank" href="https://www.openstreetmap.org">OpenStreetMap</a> via Overpass API.</p>
<p>Website uses leaflet.js for building view.
<p>Website uses leaflet-sidebar-v2 javascript plugin.</p>
<p> </p>
<p>This website and all code are given as they are, without any guarantee.</p>
<p><strong>Have fun!</strong></p>
